A few Notes before compiling code

•To run code enter in   ./run_code.sh

•The code uses data for ratings.csv, which takes about a minute or two to run

•If you do not want to wait for the long run time, you can go into the HW2-Programming.py and change what file is being opened in getdata() and setdata() functions to ratings2.csv which is a smaller version of ratings.csv

•I did not use the additional csv files that you included, this was all based on ratings.csv

•The Outfile should have the results of the program
